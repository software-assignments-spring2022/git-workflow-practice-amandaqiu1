[Tim Cook Just Revealed Apple's Plan for Expansion into AR/VR](https://www.inc.com/jeff-steen/tim-cook-just-revealed-apples-plan-for-expansion-into-ar/vr-its-opposite-of-facebook.html)

## Comments
With the launch of Meta and the Metaverse, tech companies are starting to develop ar/vr teachnology. Apple is taking a different approach from Facebook in that it is prioritizing security and privacy, which is the main concern with Facebook/Meta. Tim Cook seems to be hesitant to expand into AR/VR development and wants to focus on transparency rather than diving right in. The metaverse is still in its most early phases and it could either be recieved extremely well and change how we live our daily lives or fail and eventually fade out. Apple is a leading technology company and it could introduce something revolutionary, if they decide to do so. It will be interesting to see the range of technologies that will develop from these companies out of innovation or competition.

This article is really interesting because of the competition we are going to see between Meta and apple. I did an article about Meta's attempts into the metaverse, so I think it is interesting to read about the different approaches from tech companies.

<br> While the prospect of a technological giant like Apple heavily investing in AR/VR is exciting, I am skeptical of their "privacy-first" claim. It may very well be that Apple's definition of 'privacy' does not mean that the user will be free from data collection. While other companies might not get access to Apple users' data, it is hard to believe that Apple itself will not collect and analyze their wealth of user information, which could then be used to further optimize its technological ecosystem.

### Comment - Matthew Shen
In this article, Tim Cook - the CEO of Apple - explains why Apple is so far behind other tech tycoons in the AR/VR technology development. He states that Apple has always put the privacy of its users as a top priority; he iterates that Apple is not a "first-in-the-market tech," but rather believes that "privacy is a basic human right." Because privacy is extremely complicated in the AR/VR scene, he has opted for Apple to take a much slower and cautious mindset; whereas competitors, such as Facebook or Google, have long been experimenting in AR/VR.
